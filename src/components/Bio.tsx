            I have four years of experience in full-stack web development, encompassing both backend and frontend technologies. Initially, I specialized in backend development, excelling in PHP and the Laravel framework for three years. However, over the last two years, I have broadened my expertise to include frontend development, particularly in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have worked with frontend frameworks such as React and Vue.js to build interactive user interfaces. On the backend, I transitioned to Node.js, specializing in Express and Nest.js for server-side development. My proficiency extends to databases, including MySQL and PostgreSQL. My approach emphasizes project success, combining strong backend and frontend skills, and I remain dedicated to staying updated with industry trends across the full stack.
